Title: How to create this website
Date:  2020-01-23

Allllright, here is a quick note on how I put together this website, because I will probably forget half of it and then, in a few months, wonder what in the world I was doing (just like any good programmer).

With Ruby installed one can run the following to install bundler and jekyll
```bash
$ gem install jekyll bundler
```

Now that we got that out of the way, we can start to create a mwa. 
The following two files are essential:

Gemfile (called Gemfile)
```bash
source "https://rubygems.org"
gem "eleven-theme"
gem "webrick", "~>1.7.0"
```

_config.yml
```text
theme: eleven-theme
```

And optionally we can already put a landing page inside, written in markdown, called index.md
```text
---
layout: home
---
Hello World!
```

Once those are safely tucked into a folder we are ready to call
```bash
$ bundle install
```
to install whatever our gemfile says.
Then all that is left to do to view the site locally is to call
```bash
$ jekyll s 
```
In case this complains about the versions installed on your system try with 
```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll s --trace
```
