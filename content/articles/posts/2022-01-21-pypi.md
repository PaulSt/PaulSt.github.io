Title: Pypi - creating a python package
Date:  2022-01-21

I just had my first rodeo with Pypi - time to put down some hopefully helpful notes, most likely for myself in 6 months. 
First things first, make an account (or for my future self: remember your passwords) at [pypi](https://pypi.org) and [testpypi](https://test.pypi.org).

To create a package one needs to include a setup.py file into the root directory of the project. The most basic structure of the file would be


```python
import pathlib
from setuptools import setup

# This call to setup() does all the work
setup(
    name="pkgname",
    version="1.0.0",
    description="...",
    packages=["pkgname"],
    },
)
```
To point to the directory of your pkg add a line like
```
    package_dir={"pkgname": "dir"},
```
It is possible to include source files **relative** to this directory by adding a line like
```
    package_data={"pkgname": ["*"]},
```
Now it should be possible to run the file
```bash
python setup.py sdist 
```
here sdist is to build a source distribution, other options check 
```bash
python3 setup.py --help-commands
```
The source pkg should land in the ./dist folder.
Time to check out the results
```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install dist/* 
```

To upload it to the test server use 
```bash
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
```
