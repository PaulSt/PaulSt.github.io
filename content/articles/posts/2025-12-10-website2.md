Title: How to create this website (again)
Date:  2025-12-10

While ruby looks shiny at first, mentaining all the packages only for my website was not my gem. 🥁
It was time to abandon ship and switch to a static site generator written in python, enter [pelican](https://getpelican.com/)!

To get started, install pelican and use the 
```python
pelican-quickstart
``` 
command to set up the initial structure:
Pelican follows a simple directory structure:
```plaintext
my_blog/
├── content/
│   ├── articles/
│   ├── pages/
│   └── images/
├── themes/
├── pelicanconf.py
└── publishconf.py
```
where `content/` holds all the markdown files, `themes/` contains the theme files, and the configuration files `pelicanconf.py` and `publishconf.py` define settings for development and production respectively.
Articles and pages are written in markdown. 
The difference between the two is that articles meant to be time-sensitive and usually include metadata like title, date, and tags, while pages are static and often used for content like "About Me" or "Contact".

Recently, I am a fan of `uv` for running python applications, so I set up a `pyproject.toml` file to manage dependencies, here is a sample with some nice pelican plugins:
```toml
[project]
name = "my_blog"
version = "1.0.0"
requires-python = ">=3.13"
dependencies = [
    "pelican[markdown]>=4.11.0",
    "minchin-pelican-plugins-summary>=1.3.0",
    "typogrify>=2.1.0",
    "beautifulsoup4>=4.14.3",
    "pelican-neighbors>=1.2.0",
    "pelican-render-math>=1.0.5",
]
```
And use a simple Makefile 
```makefile
PELICAN := $(shell command -v uv >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "uv run pelican" || echo "python3 -m pelican")

BASEDIR=$(CURDIR)
INPUTDIR=$(BASEDIR)/content
OUTPUTDIR=$(BASEDIR)/output
CONFFILE=$(BASEDIR)/pelicanconf.py
PUBLISHCONF=$(BASEDIR)/publishconf.py

clean:
	rm -rf $(OUTPUTDIR)
publish:
	$(PELICAN) $(INPUTDIR) -o $(OUTPUTDIR) -s $(PUBLISHCONF)
serve:
	$(PELICAN) -lr $(INPUTDIR) -o $(OUTPUTDIR) -s $(CONFFILE) -b 0.0.0.0 -p 8000

.PHONY: clean publish serve
```
